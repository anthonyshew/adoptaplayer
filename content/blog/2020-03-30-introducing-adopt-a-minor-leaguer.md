## Hello, everyone.

And welcome to the Adopt a Minor Leaguer Blog.

In this blog, you are going to watch us grow right along with our community. We will keep you updated with what's going on in baseball, our AaML community, and stuff that goes on with our non-profit (our ***what?!***) Hold on, we'll get there!

## The Current State of Affairs

As of today, 364 sponsorships have been made as a part of the Adopt a Minor Leaguer community. That's a lot of work for one man over the course of 6 weeks.

Our founder, Michael Rivers, has gotten a lot of press in a short amount of time. He has done interviews with SI.com, several podcasts, and been mentioned all over social media.

Michael has taken on two new team members in the past week or so.

Anthony Shew is a current minor leaguer for the St. Louis Cardinals. He also does web development on the side - and that is how Michael and Anthony joined forces. The pair are now in the process of creating a legal entity for AaML and Anthony just got done with the website you are looking at!

Mariana Guzman is Michael's Spanish-speaking savior. Mariana has taken over any communications with Latin players and organizations that have needed to occur and been instrumental in several sponsorships thus far.

## Where do things go from here?

The sky is the limit if you ask us! Even with accomplishing so much in such a short amount of time (all thanks to Michael), there is so much more to do to help minor league baseball and minor leaguers. Stay tuned for what's next for this community. It's gunna be big.
