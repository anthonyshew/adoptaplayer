Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer partners with Entourage Athletics to Help Minor Leaguer Ballplayers
Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer and Entourage Athletics Launch Joint Initiative to Help Underpaid Minor League Baseball Players Earn Much-Needed Supplemental Income.

For Immediate Release – March 12, 2012

Eagan, MN – Today, Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer and Entourage Athletics are proud to announce a strategic partnership to provide Minor League Baseball Players with an opportunity to launch their own Remote Coaching Business to supplement their incomes.

The Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer Remote Coaching Initiative will enable minor league baseball players to earn up to $60/hour, supplementing often inadequate wages, while imparting their knowledge and experience to young baseball players all over the world using Entourage Athletics’ Mobile Application.

In addition to the direct income each Minor Leaguer would receive as compensation for his coaching activities, Entourage Athletics is pledging an annual donation to Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer in the amount of 10% of net proceeds from memberships sales through the Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer Remote Coaching Initiative which will launch to the public on the Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer and Entourage Athletics Websites on April 1, 2021.

Recent changes to the Major League Baseball Minor League System will see wage increases for players on rosters of Affiliated Minor League Baseball Teams in 2021, but even with this increase players still earn wages below minimum wage and with more than half of players in the Minors playing in non-affiliated minor leagues in North America and thousands more playing in Latin America, Australia, Asia and Europe, players still find themselves struggling to make ends meet while trying to achieve their dreams of making it to The Show.

Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer, a registered 501 C (3) charitable organization, which was founded in 2019 by Michael Winters following his father’s diagnosis of Cancer, has already connected over 500 minor leaguers and generous sponsors, helping minor leaguers through an even-tougher-than-normal, coronavirus-stricken 2020 baseball season by providing them with monthly care packages including gift cards, clothing equipment and toiletries. This partnership agreement with Entourage Athletics will allow minor leaguers to earn income as independent baseball coaches on Entourage Athletics’ premium remote coaching platform where they will be able to provide online remote baseball coaching to young athletes who wish to improve their game, giving them a chance to connect with and support a minor league baseball player in the process.

Supporters of Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer who do not have a need for personal baseball training can opt to sponsor a young baseball player anywhere in the world and assign their membership to them, thereby helping a minor leaguer and a young baseball player in need as well as help the growth of the game.

The Entourage Athletics Mobile Application, which officially launched on February 1, 2021, was created by Co-founders Yannick Bergeron and Menashi Mashaal to provide athletes around the world with the opportunity to work with elite experts in their field, without geographic restrictions, to improve their game and help achieve their personal goals, while giving coaches the opportunity to make a greater impact by reaching more athletes through remote coaching and utilizing technology to make coaching/training more efficient. The partnership agreement with Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer will give young athletes the opportunity to be coached by a Minor League Ballplayer through a special Entourage Athletics Membership and easy-to-use Mobile Application.


“As a current minor leaguer, I live the financial hardship that is Minor League Baseball. I wish something like Entourage Athletics would have come around earlier in my career. Luckily, we have their platform today, and a community to bring to that platform through Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer. I hope that every player will be interested in this opportunity and uses it to make their life as a minor leaguer more comfortable and less stressful,” says Anthony Shew, CTO of Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer.

“Being a former Independent League Ballplayer and having many friends and former students playing in the minor leagues, I understand the struggle and we want to be able to help the players out.” Says Yannick Bergeron, Coach and Co-Founder of Entourage Athletics. “In Partnering with Adopt-a-Minor Leaguer, we are able to reach thousands of Minor League and Indy League ballplayers.” Says Menashi Mashaal, Co-Founder. “We empower them with the tools and infrastructure to build and run their own online coaching business, giving them the opportunity to earn much-needed income, while doing something they know and love and connecting them with thousands of young baseball players and fans all over the world to further build the sport and grow the baseball community. It really is a win-win-win partnership”.
